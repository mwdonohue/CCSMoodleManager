# About
A bit of context is needed to explain this project.  In 2019, I began working at a school as a distance math instructor, using Moodle as a virtual "classroom". Every month or so, I would leave my comfy dorm at NCSU to visit family. In addition to visiting family, I would also aim to teach an in-person class or two. During my March visit of 2020, the principal of the school confronted me. He mentioned that, due to COVID-19, the school might be going online for the rest of the year and he wondered if I could put together a program for the rest of the school. I agreed and thus began an incredibly stressful spring break.

No need to give more context -- I can actually discuss the project now. The CCSMoodleManager is a project designed to automate the truly painful part of trying to move the entire school online in a week. Simply stated, this program takes a huge file containing enrollment information for faculty and students, and smooshes it down into a "moodle readable" format.

# Planned Additions
None. This project is finished as far as I'm concerned

# Possible Additions
If I was to add ANYTHING to this project it would be a user friendly GUI. Maybe if I'm bored one of these days.
